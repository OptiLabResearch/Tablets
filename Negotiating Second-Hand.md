# Guide to Negotiating Prices When Buying a Second-Hand Tablet

Buying a second-hand tablet can save you a lot of money, but knowing how to negotiate effectively is key to getting the best deal. This guide covers strategies, expected price reductions, and factors that influence negotiations.  


## Quick Summary: Negotiation Strategies 
- **Do Your Research**: Know the market price before negotiating.  
- **Check the Listing Age**: Older listings are easier to negotiate.  
- **Look for Imperfections**: Any scratches, dents, or missing accessories give you leverage.  
- **Bundle Negotiation**: Ask for accessories (charger, case, stylus) to be included.  
- **Be Polite and Confident**: Sellers are more likely to give a discount if they like you.  
- **Offer Cash or Instant Payment**: Many sellers prefer a quick, hassle-free sale.  
- **Time Your Offer**: Negotiating before salary dates or near major sales events can help.  


## How Much Can You Negotiate? (General Price Reductions by Category) 

| **Factor**                 | **Negotiation Range (%)** | **Notes** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Brand** (Apple, Samsung, etc.) | 5-20% | Apple devices hold value best (5-15% reduction), while Android tablets usually see larger discounts (10-20%). |
| **Age of Tablet** | | |
| 0-1 years old (newer models) | 5-15% | Prices stay firm, but minor discounts are possible. |
| 1-3 years old | 15-30% | Ideal range for negotiation; sellers often accept lower offers. |
| 3+ years old | 30-50% | Older models lose value quickly. Strong negotiation potential. |
| **Tablet Category** | | |
| Budget Tablets (<$300 new) | 15-40% | Lower resale value, higher negotiation room. |
| Mid-Range ($300-$700 new) | 10-30% | Good balance between demand and depreciation. |
| Premium Tablets ($700+ new) | 5-25% | Premium models (iPads, Galaxy Tab S-series) hold value better. |
| **Condition** | | |
| Like New | 5-10% | Minimal negotiation room. |
| Light Wear (Minor scratches) | 10-20% | Point out small flaws to reduce price. |
| Moderate Wear (Noticeable scratches/dents) | 20-40% | Strong leverage if functional but visually worn. |
| Heavy Wear (Cracks, battery issues) | 40-60% | Risky purchase—only worth it for parts or repair. |



## Pro Tips for Negotiating Successfully

### **1️⃣ Do Your Research First**  
- Check **current used prices** on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Swappa.  
- Look at completed listings to see what people are actually paying.  

### **2️⃣ Let the Seller Set the Price First**  
- If they ask for your offer first, respond with:  
  > "I’m seeing similar models selling for less. What’s the lowest you’d take?"  

### **3️⃣ Start with a Lower Offer**  
- **Offer 15-30% less** than the asking price (but not insultingly low).  
- Expect the seller to counter with a middle ground.  

### **4️⃣ Use Defects & Missing Items as Leverage**  
- If the listing doesn’t include a **charger, box, stylus, or case**, ask for a discount.  
- Cosmetic flaws = more negotiation power.  

### **5️⃣ Time Your Negotiation**  
- Older listings (2+ weeks) = sellers more likely to drop price.  
- End of the month = sellers may need quick cash.  
- Right before a new model release = better deals.  

### **6️⃣ Use “Bundle Negotiation”**  
- If the seller has accessories, ask to include them for free or at a discount.  
- Example:  
  > "I’ll take the tablet for $250 if you throw in the stylus and case."  

### **7️⃣ Be Ready to Walk Away**  
- If the seller won’t budge and you’re unsure, politely say:  
  > "Thanks for your time! If you change your mind, let me know."  
- Many sellers will contact you later with a lower price.  



##  Conclusion: What’s a Good Deal?
A good negotiation can save you **10-30%** off the original ask price, depending on brand, age, and condition. By being polite, prepared, and persistent, you can maximize your savings and get the best value for your money.
